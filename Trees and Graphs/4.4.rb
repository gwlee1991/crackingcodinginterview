# Check Balanced: Implement a function to check if a binary tree
# is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balance tree is 
# defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtress of 
# any node never differ by more than once.

# we need to do this recursively.
# our check would be when either right or left's node is nil
# the node that is not nil should not have a child node.
