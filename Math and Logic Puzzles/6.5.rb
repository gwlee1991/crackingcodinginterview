# Jugs of Water: You have a 5-quart jug, a 3-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but
# no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly 4- quarts of water? Note that the jugs
# are oddly shaped. such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

# ez
# fill 3-j and pour it into 5-j.
# fill 3-j and pour it into 5-j. This leaves 1 quart in the 3-j.
# empty 5-j and pour the 1 quart from 3-j to 5-j.
# fill 3-j.
# pour 3quarts in 3-j to 5-j.
# 4 quarts.
